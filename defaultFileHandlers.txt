Change the default for certain files (in my case, change from gedit to Emacs for files).

Hop in to these two files:
/usr/share/applications/defaults.list - The system defaults list.
~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list - The user's personal desktop session defaults list.

Change anything that is gedit (or whatever the default text editor depending on DE),
to your pick (in my case emacs.desktop).
